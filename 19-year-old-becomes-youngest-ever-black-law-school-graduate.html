Taylor Schlitz, a homeschooled student, graduated high school by the age of 13.</p><p>Taylor Schlitz is not only passionate about her own education, she is passionate about advocating for education equality for Black children in general.</p><p>“There is overwhelming data showing that Black boys and girls are disproportionately disciplined. Georgetown Law has done an in-depth study showing how Black girls are adultified in our schools.” <a href=#>Taylor Schlitz said recently</a>. “Add in lack of resources and access to advanced education opportunities such as AP courses and gifted and talented programs, and we see that Black students face serious barriers in our education system.”</p><p>She continued,”We must become our own advocates, demand equity, and be willing to supplement the educational needs of Black children.”</p><p>Taylor Schlitz is truly humble about her educational success and said that she wouldn’t be where she is without her parents and siblings.</p><p>“Without their support and dedication, my siblings and I would not have had the opportunities we have had,” she said. “They also have ensured that we had time to explore our non-academic interests. I appreciate how they ensured we could explore everything we ever wanted to explore.”</p><p>Some of the biggest names around the globe have extended congratulations to Taylor Schlitz. Among those is Emmy Award winning talk show host, <a href=#>Tamron Hall</a>, who mentioned her at the start of her talk show.&nbsp;</p><p>Photos: HaleyTaylorschlitz.com</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>134</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOanBmsZWWv267y51km52TpLqmv4yypq6ml5rAtXnEr5yrZZKhrqS3jKWYsGWjmLWwu8tmnquZlKqutbGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
