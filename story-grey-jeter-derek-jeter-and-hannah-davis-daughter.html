All About Derek Jeter and Hannah Davis Daughter</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-08</div><p><strong>Story Grey Jeter is the daughter of Derek Jeter, the former professional baseball player, and his wife, Hannah Jeter, who is an American model. Story was born on January 31, 2019, and is presently 4 years old. She is the second among the three children that Derek Jeter and Hannah Davis have. Her other siblings are Bella Raine Jeter and River Rose Jeter.</strong></p><p>Story Grey Jeter is still a very little child, and her fame is tied to the successes of her parents, who have made a name for themselves in their individual careers. Without so much known about the celebrity kid, here is all we have uncovered.</p><h3><b>Summary of <strong>Story Grey Jeter</strong>’s Bio&nbsp;</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Story Grey Jeter</li><li><b>Gender:</b> Female</li><li><b>Date of birth:</b> 31 January 2019</li><li><b>Story Grey Jeter’s Age: </b>4 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity:</b> White</li><li><b>Nationality:</b> American</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign:&nbsp;</b> Aquarius</li><li><b>Religion:</b> Catholic</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Story Grey Jeter’s Parents: </b>Derek Jeter (father ) and Hannah Davis (Mother)</li><li><b>Siblings: </b>River Rose Jeter, Bella Raine Jeter</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the daughter of Derek Jeter and Hannah Davis</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Story Grey Jeter?</strong></h2><p>Story Grey Jeter was born on August 17, 2017, which means she is currently 4 years old. She was birthed in Miami, Florida, where she is being raised by her parents, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Derek Jeter</a> and Hannah Jeter.</p><p>Of white ethnicity and American nationality, the celebrity kid enjoys a jealously guarded childhood together with her siblings. While it is obvious that she is of elementary school age, nothing is known about the school she is currently attending.</p><p>The 4&nbsp; year-old has been in the limelight since she was born, thanks to the fame of her parents. As indicated, her mother is a model who started her career in the beauty and fashion industry very early. Hannah had already started modeling and traveling the world when she was only 14 years old. She has been involved in campaigns for many reputable brands, including Ralph Lauren and Blue Label.</p><p>On the other hand, Story’s father is a big name in sports. He is a former Major Baseball League star who played in the MLB for 20 seasons. The Baseball Hall of Famer began his career in 1995 for the New York Yankees, and he remained with the team until 2014 when he retired.</p><p>In his almost two decades in the MLB, Story’s father became the World Series Champion five times, and he also clinched five Gold Glove Awards as well as five Silver Slugger Awards. He has 13 All-Star appearances to his name, and he is a Monument Park honoree.</p><h2><strong>Story Grey’s Parents Are Still Together</strong></h2><p>Story’s Grey Jeter’s parents are still together since tying the knot in 2016. The couple has enjoyed a great relationship through the years, and this has been crowned with the birth of their three wonderful kids thus far. The first time Story’s parents met was in 2012, thanks to a mutual friend in a restaurant that Hannah and her mother visited.</p><p>Before they met, Hannah was not a baseball fan and didn’t know who her husband was. This was until after she moved to New York City from the U.S. Virgin Islands, where she was brought up. She stated that she initially thought he was a pitcher and not a shortstop.</p><p>Her move coincided with the end of Derek’s relationship with his former lover, Minka Kelly, who some <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reports</a> claimed he married. Their mutual friend introduced them to each other afterward, and it didn’t take Story’s parents too long before they started dating. They were sighted in public for the first time in 2012, but they kept all about their love life away from the public until they got engaged in November 2015.</p><p>Less than a year later, they got married on July 9, 2016, in Napa Valley. According to Hannah, she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">believes</a> both of them had lived their lives before meeting and getting married. The ceremony was a small one with less than a hundred guests in attendance, made up of very close friends and family members.</p>7 Years&nbsp;after the marriage between Derek Jeter and Hannah, the pair have managed to stay away from major dramas that mostly eclipse the marriages of celebrities. There have been no controversies or rumors of scandals between the two, which has helped them to provide a loving environment for Story Grey Jeter and her siblings.<p>Before Story’s parents met, her father had previously been in some high-profile relationships, including with famous singer <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mariah Carey</a> who revealed that she could not <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">wait</a> to end her abusive marriage to Tommy Mottola.</p><h2><strong>Story Grey Jeter Has Two Siblings</strong></h2><p>As stated, Story is not the only child of her parents; she has an older and a younger sibling. Her older sister is Bella Raine Jeter, and the youngest member of the family is River Rose Jeter.</p><p>Bella was born on August 17, 2017, which means she is now 6 years old and is over a year older than her sister. In February 2017, her parents announced that they were expecting their first child together, and then in August, the couple welcomed their little one. Before the birth of Story’s older sister, her mum wrote in an essay that she wanted her kids to have a normal life and be strong little people.</p><p>The younger sister of Story Jeter and the youngest member of the family is River Rose Jeter. She was born on December 2, 2021. Unlike her older sisters, the couple kept the pregnancy of their last kid private, and her birth was only announced days after she arrived. As she continues to grow, her parents ensure to keep her life as private as possible, except for the public appearances she makes with the whole family.</p><h2><strong>Story and Her Siblings are Well-Protected by Their Parents</strong></h2><p>Story and her siblings live between New York and Florida, where her father owns homes. The kids often make an appearance on their parents’ social media pages, but they have also been strictly protected. Because of this, information about the early interests of Story has remained elusive from the media. Also, the kids are rarely seen in public events with their parents.</p><p>The only thing that is known about the little girl is that, judging by her earliest interests, she may not be an athlete like her father. She once revealed that she was not a fan of baseball, and she had some reservations about visiting Yankee Stadium with her parents and sisters prior to the induction of her father to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2020.</p><p>One of the main reasons why Jeter and his wife are ensuring that their kids are protected from any undue media attention and public scrutiny is because, as stated, they want Story and their other kids to have a very normal life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmrKyfp8Zus9GesGailamys3nDnqmeo12fsrWx0WaYp5xdna6vusChZJ2Zpp7AbrDArp6hrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
