Only a few years were spent as partners by Rick and Belsky; their courtship came to an end with Belsky’s passing in the early 1990s.
Nevertheless, they had two kids when they were living together.
Rick, Belsky’s spouse, was one of the comedy’s most recognizable faces in the 1980s.
Moranis, however, began to fade away at the beginning of the 1990s and was practically written off as a bygone personality."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

away from acting and Hollywood.</p><p>In addition to his wife’s passing, it was clear that he also needed to care for his children completely.</p><p>Rick later revealed to USA Today in 2005:</p><p>“<i>I pulled out of making movies in about ’96 or ’97.</i>“</p><p>The “Flintstones” star said it was simply too tough for him to manage his kids while traveling and working on his movies because he had become a single dad.</p><p>Rick claimed that he made the decision to take a brief hiatus as a result of everything.</p><p>The actor, who was born in Toronto, acknowledges that the brief gap extended.</p><p>Moranis said he doesn’t miss acting at all, though.</p><p>A Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves direct-to-video sequel was one of his final projects before the break.</p><p>Following that, he performed one voice role per month.
