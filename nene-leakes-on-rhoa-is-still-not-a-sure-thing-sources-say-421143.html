In fact, insiders claim the conversations are still underway.</p><p>According to a report from the website, Love B. Scott, Leakes won’t be coming back for the 13th season, because executives want to get new talent on the series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">so it’s more attractive to a younger demographic.</a></p><p>Reportedly, Drew Sidora, 35, and LaToya Ali, 33, will join the cast of the popular reality TV series. This rumor comes at the same time as reports swirl that Leakes is in trouble with the producers of the Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><p>For example, this Friday, Leakes dropped a number of posts in which she asked her fans and followers if they had ever “worked with a sociopath” who used them for personal gain. Leakes also described being in a situation similar to that of Tamar Braxon, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who reportedly tried to kill herself.</a></p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CC6OSOnACq9/</p><p>As it was previously reported, Tamar Braxton tried to kill herself after sending a fiery letter to her bosses over at WeTV. She has allegedly argued that working on the series, Braxton Family Values, led her to her current mental state.</p><p>Tamar was reportedly rushed to a hospital after she intentionally took many prescription pills in a suicide attempt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her boyfriend was the one to call the authorities</a> who managed to rush her to the hospital in time to save her life.</p><p>Leakes claimed in her post that she has been dealing with very similar circumstances to Tamar Braxton.</p><p>According to NeNe, there are certain situations where a person simply doesn’t have another choice. Regarding her return, and her comments toward the idea, NeNe said she’d keep her fans updated.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Other stars have complained of the entertainment business as well, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Chappelle,</a> who famously quit&nbsp;Chappelle’s Show&nbsp;at the peak of its success.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2K8r3nRoaaaZZmoerTAyKWjZqafqXqiedKuqZ5lpJ22r7OMrKauqpOawG6%2FwLJkbWphZoF0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
