The Hardy Boyz infamously had such little chemistry as opponents that their feuds were ultimately short-lived. Edge and Christian may not have been blood brothers but their feud failed to produce such a bout, too.<br></p><p>It remains to be seen whether Jimmy vs.Jey will be more Bret vs. Owen or Matt vs. Jeff, but the heat surrounding the program makes it the prime candidate to star atop the Payback card.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGqAdYCMnpirpKliuqLAwqFknJmimXqxvsSdoJysmaS7tHnFqKlmr6eaerGt2JuYnKNdZ31zf4yana2domLAtrnMnqmspJGierOx0q6jras%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
