I did not recognize her at first ❤️”</p><p>“Obsessed with this look 🔥 Marlo! Everything about this is a WHOLE YESSSS 😩😍.

They can’t do nothing wit you ❤️”</p><p>Hampton isn’t just known for her expensive taste in fashion, she’s also a staple in the hair industry.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the HER Hair collection founder explained to her fans why she arguably is obsessed with wigs.</p><p>“I love wearing wigs as protective styles so my natural hair can rest, hydrate and grow,” she said via <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Instagram</a>. “I change my hair often to coordinate with my outfits (as any real fashion girl does) an outfit may call for a certain hair color or cut to pull off the look. Over processing and over styling natural hair causes so much damage.”</p><p>Hampton says she created her hair line to help women experiencing hair damage.</p><p>“I created&nbsp;@her_hair_collection&nbsp;for women like me!! Women who are not ashamed to throw on a luxurious impeccably styled wig and be fabulous, women suffering from health issues and hair loss or women just trying to repair their natural from years or wear and tear.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe49qZmxoX5eyosHTop2upF2irrO4zmafmqWgqbyvecCnm2acmZmxur%2BMnZiun5ipsrN5wqGYp5uVYr%2Bwr8pmq6GdXaiurrGMrKalmZOaeq27zZ2mp2WUp7K0v44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
