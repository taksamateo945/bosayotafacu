He fulfilled a promise to his mother, who did not attempt to hide her glee.</p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>“I can’t really explain how proud I am of him,” his mom, Gina Johnson, said. “Because it was very important. It wasn’t just important, it was very important. It was what he was here for. I told coach (Randy) Rahe, ‘I really don’t care about basketball. I want him to have a degree.’ “</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>The two-time All-Star had promised his mother he would complete his degree when he turned pro. Johnson and about nine other family members and friends were in the stands at the Dee Events Center for the ceremony.</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>Lillard told The Associated Press it was important to return so his family could take part. He started the proceedings with one of two speeches from graduating students. Lillard earned a professional sales degree from the College of Applied Science and Technology and capped the event as the last student to walk and receive his degree. He wanted the sheepskin for his mother and himself, but also he said he hopes his story will inspire others. Lillard said his involvement with the Special Olympics and an anti-bullying movement began with his experiences at Weber State.</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>“(College is) about the experience and lot of the things that you pick up along the way,” Lillard said. “Even if it’s not directly your education. … It can be anything. I’m grateful for what I have here. Anything you start you should want to finish. Especially your education.”</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>Lillard had three classes to finish and met with teachers last summer to arrange a way to complete those credits without having to spend all of his time in Ogden, Utah. He wrapped everything up during the winter, during the NBA season.</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>Lillard texted the news to his mother, who was surprised because she thought he was just training in Ogden during those summer trips.</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>“I said, ‘What, you’re finished?’ ” Johnson said with a laugh. “I got on the phone calling everybody, ‘Damian’s graduating. He’s finished.’ It was just a really exciting moment because I couldn’t wait. It’s been a long time coming.”</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>Lillard said he couldn’t sleep the night before the Blazers were eliminated by Memphis in the playoffs, so he began thinking about his speech at 5 a.m. Game 6 of the series would have been played Friday and Lillard had contemplated skipping shoot-around to fly in, attend the ceremony and fly back for the game.</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>A large part of Lillard’s speech was spent thanking those at the university who helped along the way.</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>“My kids don’t believe it,” said Carl Grunander, Lillard’s academic adviser. “Damian’s been a real pleasure. He’s been very self-motivated. Never had to push him. He’s always wanted to do it. Always done it in a quiet way. He just gets it done.”</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>Rahe added, “Damian’s a helluva basketball player, but he’s a lot better person than he is a player.”</span></p><p style="background:#fff;vertical-align:baseline;margin:0 0 15pt"><span style=font-size:12pt;font-family:georgia;color:#333>Lillard explained that he didn’t write the speech out and wasn’t nervous. With his final words, Lillard had the basketball arena roaring again: “I am Weber State.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX52e49uZmlqX5e5osbEq6pmnJGitqK6jKWgpaSRp7FuscCrpaxlk6S5rbHGnmSdnZensqZ5xa6jn6Gcobavs4ypqailmaiybrnOrZ%2Beql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
