In the video, which has been circulating online, Timberlake has a straight face, which sparked the assumption the two artists had some sort of unkind interaction.</p><p>However, everything is not what it seems. According to a source close to the situation, no altercation between the two took place. In fact, the interaction was the exact opposite.</p><p>“Meg loves Justin,” the source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET </a>Online. “She was saying, ‘No, no, no, we’ve never met before.’ It was their first time meeting, and she was excited.”</p><p>The “Bongos” rapper later took to social media with a fun-filled video featuring the “SexyBack” vocalist to also clear up any false rumors about a possible argument.</p><p>“I just talk with my hands lol @justintimberlake love ya,” Megan wrote in a post on Instagram.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Megan Thee Stallion (@theestallion)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-halle-bailey-and-yung-miami-ignite-pregnancy-rumors><strong>Halle Bailey and Yung Miami Ignite Pregnancy Rumors</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Amongst the dazzling pink carpeted looks, two other celebs managed to be the talk of the town due to their chosen ensembles. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halle Bailey</a> rocked a gorgeous orange halter gown which loosely fell over her stomach. She paired the bright-colored dress with gold accessories and a black handbag, which can be seen covering her stomach in a now-viral video.&nbsp;</p><p>Many social media investigators suggested that the oversized outfit and bag placement were used to hide her seemingly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">poking belly</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The allegations are whooping Halle’s ass 🫠<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1GyeDT4Osw</a></p>— Putty™️ (@QuanTurrell) <a href=#>September 13, 2023</a></figure><p>As for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yung Miami</a>, whose real name is Caresha Brownlee, she rocked a black bodysuit with a bikini-style bottom in the front and long and flowy floor-length sleeves.
