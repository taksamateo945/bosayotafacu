— Excellent arm length to establish first meaningful contact on defenders.
— Solid run-blocker who runs his feet through contact with tight hand placement and strong hands to control and steer defenders.
— Plays with an aggressive demeanor and flashes some impressive rotational power and torque to create lift and tip defenders over in the running game."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Jones excels as a run-blocker, running his feet through contact with tight, strong hands to clench up defenders, steer and control them through the whistle. He flashes some impressive torque to create lift and tilt defenders off balance, with an aggressive, physical demeanor to finish.</p><p>Jones struggles to stay square, centered and rooted in the ground in pass protection due to his marginal range to get to his landmarks against wide rush angles, forcing him to open his hips early and create soft edges. This also limits his ability to anchor when rushers convert speed to power, and he has a tendency to catch rather than strike, giving easy access to his frame and inside shoulder.</p><p>Overall, Jones has the length, grip strength and competitive toughness to warrant a look as a draftable backup quality prospect. His technique from the ground up needs to be revamped in pass protection for him to have a chance to stick long-term.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 5.9 (Backup/Draftable - 6th-7th round)</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Isaiah Prince</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloYmaBcoKMm6masKSku262zqecrGWem7lusNGana1lYmV%2Fc3nSnKaurJmjtG6%2BxKmmq6xdm7yzedKorK2glae7bsHTmp9mp6Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
