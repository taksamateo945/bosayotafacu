Truly Grateful!”</p><p><a href=#>Kel Mitchell</a> became a father 23 years ago when he welcomed his son, Lyric Mitchell, with his then-wife Tyisha Hampton.

Kel responded to the love from his wife with a beautiful note of gratitude.</p><p>“Thank you, my love,” the actor wrote to his wife. “You always make Father’s Day so special for me,” <a href=#>Kel</a> told Asia. “You make every day special,” he added. “Love you forever!
