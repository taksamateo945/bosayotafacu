Thompson claimed in his <a href=#>original court filing</a> that his father has had no involvement in Amari’s life and that he has been the sole caregiver of his brother since his mother’s unexpected death earlier this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2023/09/Tristan-Thompson3-e1694474587682.jpg><p>The documents further stated that, “Amari is a minor and has medical conditions that render him unable to take care of himself or seek gainful employment.”</p><p>The filing continued to read, “Appointing a guardian for Amari would be in his best interest because it would ensure that someone would be responsible for providing and fulfilling his basic needs. Further, Amari is set to receive a modest inheritance from his recently deceased mother and a guardian wouldn’t be able to manage and invest in Amari’s inheritance on his behalf.”</p><p>Thompson’s mother died suddenly of a reported heart attack in Toronto, Canada. Since then, the teen has been living with his older brother in his Hidden Hills estate in California.&nbsp;</p><p>The 32-year-old athlete, in addition to helping his brother navigate health issues and ensure that he receives the proper round-the-clock medical care, also wishes to protect and manage Amari’s inheritance from their mother’s estate. As guardian, Thompson will also be able to apply for Amari’s U.S. citizenship as he was born in Canada.</p><p>Thompson’s father has yet to contest his eldest son’s legal actions.</p><p>Photo Credit: Tristan Thompson Instagram; Khloe Kardashian Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWxmaXFfZ35wwNGiqq2ZnmLBqbvMqaqopl2ewG6t1pqpnZ2UYsGmuc%2BoqZqqqWK0tq3RnaCapqOdtrF5zp9ksqelo7SmvoybqaismJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
