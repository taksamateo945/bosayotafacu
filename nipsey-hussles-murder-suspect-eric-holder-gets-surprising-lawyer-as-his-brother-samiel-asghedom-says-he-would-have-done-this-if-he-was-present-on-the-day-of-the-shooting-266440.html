After police arrested a man and charged him with the murder, 29-year-old Eric Holder has now announced that he is pleading not guilty to the charges.

I just wish I would’ve been there.”</p><p>Samiel concluded with: “He made something work in an area that was run-down, that people were scared to come to, and he turned it into a landmark. All races. Different states. Many countries. They all come to Crenshaw and Slauson. He was truly the people’s champ.”</p><p>Some witnesses insist that it was indeed Holder that they saw at the crime scene.</p><p>It is not clear how many of them are willing to testify in the upcoming proceedings, however.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Authorities are looking for more information on the case and have urged anyone who has additional details to step forward and assist the investigation.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeenr20sdhmn66ro6GytHnMrqmdnaJiwLa%2Fz56arWWVp7akeceoo52domK0psDSZqquqqCntrS1zaBkpZmnrrKzecCsZKGho2Kvs7vToZyrZaOWuqqxy2aYrJ%2BYmrGwuYysmLKrXZ2ybsPOrqOdZZiWw6Z5w6ilnmWknba0ecifZKGdXayutHnPq5ysnZ6perC6jK2fnmWUlsZuu8Vmq6GdXai1sLvToqWgZWJrg3WAj2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
