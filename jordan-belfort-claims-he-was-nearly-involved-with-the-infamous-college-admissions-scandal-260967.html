Jordan claims that he managed to avoid taking the bait, unlike other people he knows.</p><p>When the star-by-implication was at the LAX airport this past weekend, reporters from TMZ asked him about the scandal which involved big schools like the University of Southern California, Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown.</p><p>According to the infamous con-man, Belfort claims his son was trying to get into Georgetown and somehow, someone, called him on his phone and wanted to involve him in the situation. He and his son managed to turn down the offer.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvU0O_2BGPv/</p><p>Belfort explained that the offer went far beyond a normal bribery situation where a family makes a “donation” so their kid can get into the school of their choice despite not having the right grades to cut it. According to Jordan, the man behind the recruitment process was likely one of Rick Singer’s “finders.”</p><p>Jordan said to reporters that he believes Singer will be going away for a long time. As it was previously reported, Huffman, Loughlin, and some of their husbands are now facing criminal charges for the college admissions scandal.</p><p>In case you never saw The Wolf of Wall Street, the movie was based around the life of the man of this report, Jordan Belfort. He was involved in a stock-market scam in the 1990s which saw him gain considerable wealth before eventually getting caught then jailed.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Recently, Jordan was involved in another scam related to the Australian company, Face to Face Training. Regardless, Jordan’s recent resurgence of notoriety has come under fire by many who claim his nebulous past should bring him shame, not fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapL%2Blrc1mmZ6klqS%2FtXnCpZiipaNitaZ51pqqZqaVlr%2BtxYyipa%2BnnKuypXnWoquhZaSdsm61zZ%2BYpqelqHqku8ulnKCdXZaxrrXSrKCopqNiwKStzZ2YpWVia316gpZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
