Some Twitter users, emphasizing Brown‚Äôs record as an abuser, remarked that the new collaboration was ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and requested Chloe to ‚Äúremove‚Äù the post and the song from the album.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chloe-Bailey-1.jpg alt="Chloe Bailey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nonetheless, numerous Twitter users hopped on the bandwagon to support Bailey, citing Chris‚Äôs talent as an artist. They reported that Bailey was ‚Äúbarely‚Äù receiving support from the internet community, but when Brown is mentioned, she is chastised.</p><h2>Chris Brown lost many commercial contracts as a result of several complaints.</h2><p>Chris Brown‚Äôs assault claims extend back to 2009 when he was dating Rihanna. At the time, the Umbrella singer was outspoken about Brown hitting her, which resulted in several injuries. He later pled guilty and admitted to hitting Rihanna at the time. He lost many business contracts as a result of the event and received a lot of criticism.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>2ND PIECE.

She accused him of following her, sending her derogatory texts, and attempting to physically hurt her. Brown received many charges after an incident with Frank Ocean, in addition to assaulting his ex-girlfriends and being engaged in domestic violence cases. Brown allegedly threatened to ‚Äúshoot him,‚Äù according to the latter. In addition, he was engaged in a hit-and-run case in Los Angeles in 2013 but avoided prison time because the charges were withdrawn.</p><p>Chris Brown has previously been in treatment for untreated bipolar illness and post-traumatic stress disorder. Another lady filed a civil action against Brown in January 2022, claiming he of r*ping her aboard a boat in Florida. According to the complaint, the event occurred in December 2020.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chloe-Bailey-2.jpg alt="Chloe Bailey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>But, when he re-entered the music industry, celebrities who have been seen in a single frame with him since then have experienced huge outrage. Similarly, former Fifth Harmony member Normani was chastised for collaborating with Chris Brown.&nbsp;How Does It Feel, Chloe Bailey‚Äôs next song starring Chris Brown, will be released on February 24, 2023.
