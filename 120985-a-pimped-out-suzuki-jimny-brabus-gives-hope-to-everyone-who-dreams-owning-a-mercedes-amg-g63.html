The cherry on top has to be the LED lights in the roof that are replicate stars when the car is driven at night.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5ede5054d1711d7c.jpg><p class=align-left>SA motoring influencer and Youtuber, Ernest Page, from&nbsp;Performance With Page said:</p>"It's the kind of car I'm glad exists in this world.
