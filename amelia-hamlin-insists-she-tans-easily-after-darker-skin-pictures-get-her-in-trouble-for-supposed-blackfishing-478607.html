I am being told that I am ‘black fishing’ – thank you all for educating me on this topic. I recently went on vacation to the sun, and with my Italian heritage, I tan very easily. There is no self-tanner involved. Or intention of looking any darker than my own skin color. I just had a lot of fun creating this look with no malice intention or offense.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>You might know that blackfishing is considered a part of cultural appropriation and many celebs have been accused of it, including Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and pretty much all of the Kardashians.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRorKttcBmn5qlnJ67brXNrKCsrKNiwKmxjK2Yp6tdmq60tcuyZJqepJq%2FbrDAq6Keql2ouKq6jKmgnKylp7K0ecaeq2aglad6qrqMramorZKhsm6yzqtkrK2gpby0scNmmaWZk6Czqr%2FHoqWgZWRshXd8lmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
