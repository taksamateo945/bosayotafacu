Right now, working. Trying to stay focused.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kcole5.png><p>On top of keeping a banging body, Cole is also working on a new music project.</p><p>In July, the R&B songstress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> she was recording her eighth studio album. Showing off her long purple tresses, Cole wrote, “The color purple is often associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, power, and ambition. Purple also represents meanings of wealth, extravagance, creativity, wisdom, dignity, grandeur, devotion, peace, pride, mystery, independence, and magic. #ALBUM#EIGHT💜.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe49yZmpuX6m1qr%2BMoqpmmZ5itq241KygqKZdm66vv4yrppqrpGK4psXSoaCaZZOkuaZ5wJ%2BrnqpdqLWmec%2Boqq2rXaeur7DOpmSpoJ%2BpvG67xWafnqpdmLmivM%2Baqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
