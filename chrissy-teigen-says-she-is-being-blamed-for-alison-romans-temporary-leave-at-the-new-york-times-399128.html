The comments she made about Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo went viral and now — people are blaming the model for the action taken.
Roman, an extremely established cook and author, said that she doesn’t agree with people like Chrissy and Marie capitalizing on their fame.

She used this for her own benefit, she could have approached her privately, but didn’t. People airing grievances in social media serves no purpose but to draw attention. They are **”both”** guilty of it,’ one person tweeted.</p><p>Another added: ‘She’s a bully on a regular basis and people cheer her in for it. They want this woman publicly flogged for daring to criticize her.’</p><p>This person said: ‘From the Holocaust tattoo, to being famous for no discernible reason, to canceling someone because her words “stung,” I just Chrissy Teigen to be awful. I hope she finds this tweet after searching her name and just roasts tf out of me.’</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alright I will believe you in that, as it is easy. But I very publicly forgave her and am getting very much blamed for her leave. And you have a lot to say on your timeline about me. Which is fine.

But I very publicly forgave her and am getting very much blamed for her leave. And you have a lot to say on your timeline about me. Which is fine.
