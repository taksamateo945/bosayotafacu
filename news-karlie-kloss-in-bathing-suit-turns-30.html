She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Vogue</span></a><span> that she loves to do pilates for this reason. "I grew up doing ballet, so it will always have a special place in my heart. I find when I take a pilates class or strength training class, I am applying similar techniques to what I learned when I was younger."</span></p><p><span>Kloss makes sure to work out on a regular basis. She also likes to do a variety of workouts. She tells Vogue, "I try to exercise at least four to five times a week and like to switch up my routine each day.

I am always trying new classes and techniques!"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/shutterstock_696813643.jpg><p><span>Kloss revealed some of her favorite foods to Vogue, including what she likes to eat for lunch. "My perfect lunch would be a delicious smoothie with a salad.

"When I first started modeling, I ate Snickers bars for breakfast, lunch, and dinner," she admits to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Byrdie</span></a><span>. "I didn't know about nutrition, or really, I always just had a super-fast metabolism. But also, because my body was maturing and growing up, I had to learn how to eat a more balanced diet. And I really learned and got excited about baking and cooking with healthy ingredients, fresh ingredients, a more balanced diet of vegetables and protein, and learning what it means to actually eat clean. In doing so, I not only feel better in my body and more confident in my body, but I also have so much more energy. That has been a whole other education."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/GettyImages-1406673925.jpg><p><span>Kloss tells Byrdie that her job has made her a stronger person. ​​"This job is one that requires a lot of hard work, a lot of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>travel</span></a><span>, a lot of time by yourself on an airplane [or] in a hotel," she says. "I feel like I've learned so much and become so much stronger because of the challenges that I've faced building a career at an early age and learning an industry from the ground up."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpJmiobamecqlpqyrXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102arrqqeqHp0fI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
