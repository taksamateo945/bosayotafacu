Dave, 35, wrote on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>He added in a photo: "Sneak Peek on the moment of truth. Inside info. Almost popped the damn thing getting it out of the car. Try to explain that to a pregnant cuban."</p><p>The actress, 30, and Brothers & Sisters alum married in October 2010. "When we went on a date, I thought, 'Well, I gotta lock this up.' I know I traded up in that deal!" Dave told Us Weekly in 2014. "I'll always be that guy in high school who got shot down for every dance." The couple, fittingly enough, announced on Mother's Day that they are expecting their first child together.</p><p>Watch the cute video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKadnaSpsm6tzZ1knZmmmnqius2amaWdXZa7r7vUp5qeZZKWr7p5xp6lnZ2iYravedWim56nXayuta%2FHZmlpaWVnfnc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
