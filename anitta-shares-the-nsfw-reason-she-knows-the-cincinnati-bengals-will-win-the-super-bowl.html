Because one of my men is playing there,” <strong>Anitta</strong> said. “One of my men.”</p><p><strong>Anitta </strong>explained that she has men in “different cities” because she is “traveling a lot.”</p><p>“Listen, it’s a lot of countries! I was yesterday in Brazil, day before I was in L.A., I’ve gotta have options,” <strong>Anitta</strong> continued. “So one of my men… I was in a strip club in Miami and I saw this guy who was super hot and I said, ‘Yo, if you don’t find anyone to have sex with tonight hotter than I am, you just call me. And if I don’t find anyone hotter than you, I call you too.’ At the end of the day, we both found… I’m practical, some Brazilian energy.”</p><p><strong>Anitta</strong> added, “So after that, I ended up going to Cincinnati and I know they’re going to win because I’m going to make sure he has a great night beforehand. I’mma make sure. I don’t know anything football. I actually thought it was soccer because we call soccer football in Brazil. So I didn’t know anything. I needed to search. But, now I know everything. He’s going to have a great night and he’s going to win the next day. Bet all your money.”</p><p></p><p>Also watch <strong>Anitta</strong> perform “Boys Don’t Cry” below!</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2QcLXADJI</a></p><p><strong>Anitta</strong> made headlines with this see-through look that she wore last year!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomZ6ewbWtjKyfmqqVqHq1tMRmpayep2K%2Fpq3SqKVmq5iaeqy6zrCqZqyYmnqktc2coKemkam2bq7Ep56apKNixKq4y2auoqZdqbWmedKup56qXZe8uLiO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
