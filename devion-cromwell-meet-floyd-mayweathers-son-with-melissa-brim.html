He was born in 1996 in the United States of America and is the adopted son of Floyd Mayweather, an American boxing promoter and former professional boxer who competed between 1996 and 2017.</p><p>Although he has never revealed his actual date of birth, the celebrity kid always celebrates his birthday in June. Devion seems to be well-educated but he has never publicly announced what his educational achievements are, or what educational institutions he may have attended in the past.</p><p>His mother, Melissa Brim, is of mixed race, while nothing is known of his biological father’s ethnicity. When Melissa got pregnant with Devion at the age of 19, she had to quit school and start work to adequately provide for her unborn child. The identity of Devon’s biological father has remained undisclosed to date. Much of Devon’s fame is attributed to the fact that he is the adopted son of millionaire former boxer, Floyd Mayweather.</p><h3><strong>Melissa Brim Met Floyd Mayweather in a Casino</strong></h3><p>Melissa met Floyd at the lounge of a Casino in Las Vegas in the late 1990s. At the time, Melissa was a single mother to Devion Cromwell. Not long after meeting Floyd, she got pregnant with their first and only child together, Iyanna.</p><p>Meeting and getting into a relationship with Floyd Mayweather can be said to be what brought Melissa Brim into the spotlight as she has been referred to as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather’s baby mama</a> on many occasions though she insists she is more than that. Since their relationship started in the late 1990s, Floyd has been a great support system for Melissa. He has been there for her in both her personal life and career. His influence on her life can be said to be what helped Melissa materialize into the successful entrepreneur she is known to be.</p><p>Their relationship also resulted in the birth of their daughter, Iyanna Mayweather and the couple have both been actively present in the lives of their two children; Iyanna and Devion Cromwell. But they have neither been married to each other nor anyone else, ever.</p><h3><strong>Devion Cromwell’s Parents </strong><strong>Separated in 2000</strong></h3><p>In 2000, after the birth of their daughter, Iyanna, the couple ceased communicating with each other. This was a result of the fact that Floyd was physically abusing Melissa at the time. Floyd Mayweather was, on two occasions, found guilty of physical abuse.</p><p>The first time was when he hit her with a car door and the second was when he struck her in the neck while they were in a mall. Throughout their separation, Floyd kept supporting their daughter’s welfare, and five years later the couple got back together and are jointly parenting their daughter.</p><h3><strong>Floyd Mayweather Never Legally Adopted Devion Cromwell</strong></h3><p>Although he is popularly known as the son of the former American boxer, Floyd is not Devon’s biological father and never adopted him legally. Devion Cromwell became known as Floyd’s son only as a result of Floyd’s amorous relationship with his mother, Melissa. The relationship started shortly after Melissa had Devion as a single nineteen-year-old girl.</p><p>Since Floyd met and started dating his ex-girlfriend Melissa Brim in the 1990s while Devion Cromwell was still a little child, he has assumed the role of a father to Devion. He has since then raised the young man as his son, even after his relationship with Devon’s mother came to an end even though he never legally adopted him.</p><h2><strong>Meet Devion Cromwell’s Family</strong></h2><table><tr><th><strong>Relationship to Devion Cromwell</strong></th><th><strong>Name</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr><tbody readability=6><tr readability=2><td>Mother</td><td>Melissa Brim</td><td>Entrepreneur and former partner of Floyd Mayweather.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Adoptive Father</td><td>Floyd Mayweather</td><td>Former professional boxer and boxing promoter.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Half-Sibling (Sister)</td><td>Iyanna Mayweather</td><td>Daughter of Floyd Mayweather with Melissa Brim.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Half-Sibling (Brother)</td><td>Koraun Mayweather</td><td>Son of Floyd Mayweather with Josie Harris.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Half-Sibling (Brother)</td><td>Zion Mayweather</td><td>Another son of Floyd Mayweather with Josie Harris.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Half-Sibling (Sister)</td><td>Jirah Mayweather</td><td>Daughter of Floyd Mayweather with Josie Harris.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Devion Cromwell Has Four Siblings All Together</strong></h2><p>Devion Cromwell has one half-sister (Iyana) from his mother and three step-siblings (2 boys; Koraun and Zion, one sister Jirah) from his father’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, former reality star Josie Harris.</p><h3><strong>Iyana Mayweather Is His Half-Sibling</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Age</strong>: 23 years old</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: May 20, 2000</li><li><strong>Mother</strong>: Melissa Brim</li><li><strong>Child</strong>: Kentrell Gaulden Jr.</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Model, Rapper</li><li><strong>Instagram</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>@moneyyaya</a></li></ul><p>Devion Cromwell’s only half-sibling is Iyanna Mayweather, Floyd Mayweather’s daughter with his mother.
