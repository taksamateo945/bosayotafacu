Lidia is curious about Andrea’s feelings towards her. Andrea responds to her question by outlining his ideal scenario for their future union.

He laughs at her claim that Jacopo is innocent when she tells him. Lidia queries what connection Maya had to the military, but the General expresses his appreciation to her for aiding in the capture of Adele’s genuine killer. He adds to the body of proof that Barberis is a killer.</p><h3>What is Jacopo’s secret?</h3><p>Enrico and Lidia speak with Jacopo. But finally, Lidia wants to speak with him privately and challenge his fabrications. Jacopo shares his secrets and explains how his heart was broken when Nicole, a lady he formerly loved, fell in love with a revolutionary leader named Louis. Despite providing them with financial assistance to flee the city, he is now unable to do so due to his imprisonment. The murder of Maya was connected to these two perpetrators.</p><p>Lidia chooses to stand by Jacopo even if he doesn’t want her to (since it would reduce his chances to prove his innocence).

She provides them with escape directions. Nicole’s wrist has a tattoo that resembles Maya’s, according to Lidia. Lidia is prompted by Nicole to pledge to save Jacopo.</p><p>Lidia then discovers the grand scheme at that point. Jacopo may have been in the wrong spot at the wrong moment when Louis killed Maya. She informs Enrico that Nicole and Louis must remain trapped in order for their hypotheses to be accurate. She hands a gun to Enrico because she wants to catch them.</p><h3>How does Lidia stop Nicole and Louis?</h3><p>Lidia chases after the train by herself and boards it with the rifle because Enrico is unable to keep up with her. To prevent them from leaving the city, she eventually locates Louis and Nicole on the train. When Louis becomes aggressive and tries to shove Lidia off the train, Nicole stops him in her terror and pushes Louis off, likely to his demise. She appears confused about killing the man she loves. Nicole is told to go to the police and confess by Lidia, who is brandishing a gun at her. Lidia is questioning Nicole’s assertion that she still has feelings for Jacopo.</p><h3>https://youtu.be/KyIeHa0zvXM</h3><h3>The Law According to Lidia Poët Season 1 Ending Explained<br>Is Jacopo Barberi released from prison?</h3><p>As The Law draws to a close Nicole is reportedly led into prison by cops in Lidia Pot Season 1.
