In fact, the former reality star is coming up on his one-year wedding anniversary to wife <strong>Catherine Giudici</strong> on Jan. 26, an impressive feat considering the amount of Bachelor Nation couples who have actually made it to the altar intact. So on Jan. 19, Lowe, 31, chose to reflect on his year of marriage in a <a href=#>new blog post</a> titled, “10 Things I’ve Learned Since My Wedding Day.”</p><p>Some of his revelations (“Life is better when you can share it with someone else” and “Waking up next to my best friend every day is the best!”) were seemingly trite, while others (“Bravo will be played in my house and I have to deal with it”) were more personalized and funny.&nbsp;</p><p>Point No. 2, “I’m not always right,” was a lesson many married men could relate to.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Not only am I not always right, but I find now that I’m married I’m usually wrong. Other husbands have told me this is normal,” Lowe wrote.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lowe also got comical, writing, “There will always be hair in the shower drain. I figured this one out pretty quickly,” and, “My days of eating chicken and asparagus every meal are over. I was a creature of habit as a single man, but the wife actually prefers variation in her diet and food with flavor.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lowe’s marriage book, For the Right Reasons: America’s Favorite Bachelor on Faith, Love, Marriage, and Why Nice Guys Finish First, hits stores on Jan. 27.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqemZ5iubDDxGZkpZ2Rp7umsIyfqailXaKus77Imp6eZZOWwamx0aKlnmWXnsKltcKiZGtoYWp%2Fcn0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
