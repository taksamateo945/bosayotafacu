Her Engagement</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>By early 2012, Golnesa was dating her boyfriend, Omid. Towards the end of 2012, Omid announced that they were getting engaged with Golnesa. Interestingly, things never went beyond that. Golnesa is already in her 30’s, yet there are no signs of getting married around the corner. So many men have tried hitting on her. She is surely a lady on high demand. When asked why she was so reluctant to get married, Golnesa explained that she was not ready to rush up things and eventually end up getting divorced by her husband. She has chosen the path of patience and prudence.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow class=IRPP_kangoo>READ MORE:Mercedes 'MJ' Javid Wiki, Net Worth, Husband, Married, Father, Bio, Weight Loss</a><p>However, not so long ago, Golnesa announced her engagement with Shalom. The two eventually ended up <strong><a href=#>getting married</a></strong>. Surprisingly, the marriage did not last for even a month. From the interview held with Golnesa immediately after the divorce, she told the media that she felt the marriage would fail just after 48 hours of commitment.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8124 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/eceleb-gossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Golnesa-Gharachedaghi-ex-husband.jpg alt="Image of Golnesa Gharachedaghi with her ex-husband Golnesa Gharachedaghi" width=600 height=570 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-8124 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Golnesa Gharachedaghi with her ex-husband Golnesa Gharachedaghi</strong></p><p>Golnesa further admitted that she has all along never believed in the institution of marriage. Her friends openly say that Golnesa has over the years struggled with committing to anyone or anything. That she let Shalom sweep her off her feet, therefore, came as a huge surprise to everyone.</p><p>The wedding itself was an interesting one. The two simply went to the courthouse and signed the relevant papers. They then entered a nearby chapel and tied the knot! All these time Shalom was in a sweat pant and Golnesa in a tattered trouser. It all looked like a joke. A very bad joke! The excitement ended so badly, and so soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Golnesa_Gharachedaghi_Net_Worth_And_Salary></span><strong>Golnesa Gharachedaghi Net Worth And Salary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Golnesa’s net worth is yet to be officially communicated.
