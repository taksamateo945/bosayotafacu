They didn’t know if their loved ones were alive or dead. And some, like Dorothy Morgan’s family, didn’t find out for sure for two decades.</p><p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, Morgan, an insurance broker with the firm Marsh & McLennan, went to work on the 94th floor of the North Tower. At 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the tower. But though it hit floors 93 through 99, Morgan’s family held out hope for her survival.</p><p>“Maybe (she) had amnesia, and was released from the hospital,” her daughter Nykiah <a href=# rel=noopener>told CNN</a>, noting that she looked for Dorothy after the attacks. “I had a whole story in my head and she was out there living life, happy.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-382159 alt="9/11 Missing Posters" width=800 height=797 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9-11-missing-posters.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-382159 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>In Pictures Ltd./Corbis via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Posters of missing people following the 9/11 attacks in New York City.</span></p><p>For two decades, Dorothy Morgan’s family waited for a definitive answer. Though an <a href=# rel=noopener>effort to identify</a> all of the 9/11 victims’ remains began shortly after the attacks, it was a difficult job, and technicians often had to extract DNA from small bone fragments — some that were the size of a Tic Tac.</p><p>But in August 2021, Dorothy Morgan’s family got the call they’d long hoped for — and dreaded. Using DNA, officials had finally identified Dorothy Morgan’s remains. She, and one other man whose family asked to stay anonymous in the press, were the 1,646th and 1,647th 9/11 victims identified that way.</p><p>For her family, the news is bittersweet. “You suddenly have to decide what to do with a loved one who died 20 years ago,” Nykiah <a href=# rel=noopener>told The New York Times</a>.</p><p>“It’s almost like reopening old wounds. Over time, you feel like you’re getting better and then this happens 20 years later and you’re dealing with it all over again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonx6eZBqZK%2Bhk6m2rr%2BObw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
