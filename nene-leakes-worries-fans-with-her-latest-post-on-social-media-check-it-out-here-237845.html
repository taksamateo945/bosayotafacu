But, I understand how it feels to literally fear for your husbandâ€™s life. Itâ€™s the most debilitating feeling in the world, yet you can not show it because you have to be strong for him. I would usually have my crying sessions in the shower so he wouldnâ€™t hear me. Please know that I am praying for you, that God will continue to give you strength, but most of all that he comfort you in your time of need, that he will hear your cries and prayer and heal your hubby, and that he also protect your family and marriage!â€™</p><p>Another commenter said â€˜Love you nene. I have been there before And itâ€™s better to cry now then have a breakdown. I know youâ€™re strong, but even angels have bad days. ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹â€™</p><p>Another one of her followers showed empathy towards NeNe and told her this:&nbsp;â€˜Know the feeling, but you see crying is good for the soul, every tear that falls, God gather them all, cause you are his child, he will wipe your eyes, through pain we gain. After that, youâ€™ll never be the same. cause lord we worship your holy name.Ms.B.â€™</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>We truly wish NeNe lots of strength to go on, and we also wish Gregg Leakes to get better and be a healthy man again.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2LEsL7RopysZZaWu7R51qKroWWYmr9uuMCtnKysXaW8tMCMqKVmq5%2BYtqK4jKacnaGRYrCpscKkZKKsXaTCtXnHnqmeZWJohHmAlGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
