Also called The Miracle of Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo was the evacuation of Allied soldiers after they became surrounded in the harbor of Dunkirk, France by the German Army.While One Direction is on hiatus; Harry, Louis, Liam, and Niall are enjoying their time off the road and using it to not only get some much-needed rest&nbsp;but explore other areas of interest that they’ve had but haven’t had the time to properly enjoy. &nbsp;It’s no surprise that some of these interests reside in the entertainment business, it’s all they’ve known for over 5 years now, and to be honest, we’d miss them in it just as much as they’d miss experiencing it.</p><p>While One Direction is on hiatus; Harry, Louis, Liam, and Niall are enjoying their time off the road and using it to not only get some much-needed rest&nbsp;but explore other areas of interest that they’ve had but haven’t had the time to properly enjoy. &nbsp;It’s no surprise that some of these interests reside in the entertainment business, it’s all they’ve known for over 5 years now, and to be honest, we’d miss them in it just as much as they’d miss experiencing it.</p><p>Some people questioned if Harry would be right for the role, or if this was an instance of a famous name being used without much thought behind it, but that question was answered when multiple people spoke on behalf of Harry and how he fought hard for his role in Dunkirk. Harry, as usual, earned what he wanted using extraordinary talent alone, his namesake had nothing to do with it.</p><p>It wasn’t because he’s a well known pop star – if anything that was more of a detriment, because it could bring the wrong message and we don’t want people pulled out of the film because of who they are. &nbsp;So Harry really had to overcome hurdles to get past that. He fought hard for it and his work was impressive and that’s what attracted us to him.</p><p>The news that Harry worked hard, read more than once for the role – during an already busy schedule – and stood out among actors that had previously worked in the industry, made names for themselves, and had standout roles under their belts, makes us even more proud of what Harry is accomplishing with his movie debut.</p><p>Harry is a natural performer and always gives 100% of himself no matter what he’s doing. &nbsp;From dancing around on stage and wowing people in interviews to shaking hands with every person who One Direction works with during a day and always making time for his fans – he seemingly never turns off. &nbsp;He also never loses kindness, compassion, or his dimpled smile in the process, and all of his interactions are genuine. &nbsp;Harry feels as blessed to have us as we feel to have him, and for the level of circumstance he’s reached, he remains unaffected by it. &nbsp;He’s set the standard for living a humble life in Hollywood, and that’s just one more thing we admire about him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2015/07/harry-styles-thank-you.gif width=500 height=260 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We aren’t surprised at all as the reports keep rolling out about Harry impressing the people working on Dunkirk and singing his praises, and we only see that continuing in his future. &nbsp;Harry is a living example that you can achieve anything you set your mind to; and with the size of his heart, there’s room for his band, his friends, his family, acting, and anything else that he’s passionate about.</p><p><strong>Everything Harry Styles does, he does with love, what a beautiful person that makes him.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktaK%2B0bJkrKypobK0ecSxrJ2do2KxprDInJitoZ%2Bjeqy1zZ2crKtdlruledKtmKtloKTEpr6MmqpmoJViwaK3xKxkqKZdp7ytsYyipWacpaO4qr7KaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
