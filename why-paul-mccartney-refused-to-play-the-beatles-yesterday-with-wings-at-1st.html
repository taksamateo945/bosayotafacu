I had to move on, but there were many people saying, ‘Don’t do this, stick with your old stuff, don’t take a new road.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXTJBr9tt8Q?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>The Beatles’ ‘Yesterday’: Paul McCartney Reacted to Elvis Presley Changing the Lyrics</a></strong></p><h2>Why Paul McCartney eventually decided to perform The Beatles’ ‘Yesterday’ with Wings</h2><p>Paul eventually performed “Yesterday” with Wings. “As time went by and the pressure was off, I could nod and wink at the Beatles stuff, so I could now do ‘Yesterday’ on a Wings tour, and it didn’t hurt,” he said.</p><p>“But until we had enough Wings songs and an identity as a group, I didn’t do any of that, even though the promoters were weeping, ‘Please finish with ‘Yesterday.’ And I’d say, ‘No, we’re not even gonna do it,’” Paul added.</p><p>After Paul changed his mind, Wings’ version of “Yesterday” appeared on the album Wings over America.
