Shamea has been away from the spotlight these past few years. She has, however, shared snippets of her life on Instagram.</p><p>Morton uploaded a video clip of the family at Shya’s school on <a href=# rel=noopener>Halloween</a>. “Happy Halloween from the Mwangi family,” the Reality TV star said. “Our sweet unicorn @princessshya had a wonderful day,” Morton added. “She was so excited for her school’s parade then she got shy,” the celebrity mom mused. “I dressed as #Elsa from #Frozen.”</p><p>In many ways, Shya has grown up in front of the camera. Shamea’s pregnancy was partially documented on <a href=# rel=noopener>Real Housewives of Atlanta</a>, and several of Shya’s developmental milestones have been shared online by her mother.</p><p>Fans are excited to see how much Shamea will share now that her family is growing by one. “So happy for you,” one social media follower shared. “I have had 10 miscarriages – it is so hard,” the supporter added in reference to Shamea speaking of her and Gerald’s journey to surrogacy. “We adopted and we are so happy we did, we got our boy and our family is complete.”</p><p>Shamea Morton and Gerald Mwangi’s baby will make them parents for the second time.</p><p>Photo: <a href=# rel=noopener>The Rious Studio/Instagram</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWtmamlfZoNwvseomGarmJa6pq2MpqarrJ%2BjeqK6w2afrquSlrulecSxp56bpJ67qHnBmpmyZZ6kenN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
