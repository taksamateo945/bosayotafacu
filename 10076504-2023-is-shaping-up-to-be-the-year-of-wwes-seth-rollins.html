He shows up, works hard, does what is asked of him and does so at the highest level. He has repeatedly proved he can have a great match with anyone and make a star out of whoever the creative team places in the ring with him.</p><p>Long before "Prison Dom" took the wrestling world by storm, Rollins introduced young Dominik Mysterio to the WWE Universe in a SummerSlam 2020 match that far exceeded expectations, especially considering it was the first professional contest for the second-generation rookie.</p><p>He has worked extensively with Austin Theory to get the United States champion ready for whatever WWE has in store for him, helped reintroduce Rhodes to the company by way of three Match of the Year candidates in 2022, all while watching as others received opportunities that probably belonged to him.</p><p>The fans recognized the effort even before management did, forcing WWE Creative's hand as Rollins transitioned from obnoxious villain to beloved, Joker-like antihero. Now, he basks in their cheers and song, ready to finally return to the mountaintop as champion.</p>Wrestlin' Quality <span class=acct>@WrestlinQuality</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Paris, France was serenading Seth Rollins with his song in the Subway! &lt;br>&lt;br>CROWN HIM. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dQz3FUNIaa">pic.twitter.com/dQz3FUNIaa&lt;/a></p><p>He will have considerable competition from Rhodes, who is still immensely popular and very much in line to eventually dethrone undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns.</p><p>The American Nightmare has become the one hurdle Rollins must overcome, The Rock to his "Stone Cold" Steve Austin. He is his competitive rival; the Superstar who will push him to be better than he has ever been before.</p><p>Rollins is there now, a virtuoso performer who has reached Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels levels of reliability when it comes to delivering between bells. The World Heavyweight Championship victory over Styles in Jeddah will be the validation he has craved and deserved for the past four years.</p><p>Roles in projects away from wrestling will cement his status as a top name in WWE in a way that all the Raw main events in the world could not.</p><p>The Visionary is about to have a career year in 2023 and establish himself as the best WWE has to offer.</p><p>All while the fans continue to sing his song.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2uCcYCMa2dra12ewG6%2Fx5qnoqaXYsKxedOoZJudXam1pnnYnpirZZ%2BberjDxKxkrJ2knXqzu8uloKer</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
