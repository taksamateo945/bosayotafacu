Reese Witherspoon and ex-husband Ryan Phillippe reunited at their son Deacon‘s football game on Saturday, May 18, in Brentwood, Calif. — but they weren’t alone on the sidelines.

Phillippe’s ex was even spotted chatting and laughing with his new love, who looked effortlessly cool in black skinny jeans, a T-shirt, and Converse <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Witherspoon, for her part, was dressed for the occasion in cropped blue jeans, a pink top, and a brown jacket. Her back-to-blonde locks were hidden under a straw hat, and she carried a simple canvas tote bag on her shoulder.

A source told <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at the time that Phillippe was unfazed by the incident and cared only that it didn’t hurt their children. “Ryan doesn’t care what she does,” the insider explained. “It’s about the kids.”</p><p>Indeed, the Straight A’s actor couldn’t help but brag a little about his children when <strong>Us</strong> caught up with him a recent party. “At 13 and 9,” he said proudly, “it’s pretty much all milestones.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvecmipGasn6m1brbOoqVmqqmWu268x6KjpaGgpbJus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnPmqyloZ6WerS4wKCrnqpdlsFuv86nZJ2dkZi8r7%2BMn6aorJKWua15xpqknmWgnrC1wdGeZGtoYWh%2BeoE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
